##  Parsing Logic Explanation

### Multi-Format Log Parser Architecture

The system handles the inherent messiness of real-world financial logs through a **hierarchical parsing strategy**:

#### **1. Pattern-Based Extraction (Primary)**
```python
# Example supported formats:
Format 1: "2023-08-15 14:30:22::user1234::withdrawal::$500.00::Downtown ATM::iPhone 12"
Format 2: "usr:user5678|deposit|‚Ç¨1200.50|Bank Branch|2023-08-15 09:15:33|Samsung Galaxy"
Format 3: "2023-08-15 23:45:12 >> [user9999] did transfer - amt=$5000.00 - Online // dev:MacBook"
```

The parser uses **13 pre-defined regex patterns** that capture:
- **Timestamps**: Multiple formats (YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY, etc.)
- **User IDs**: Various naming conventions (user1234, usr:5678, etc.)
- **Actions**: Transaction types (withdrawal, deposit, transfer, purchase)
- **Amounts**: Multi-currency with symbols ($, ‚Ç¨, ¬£) and formatting
- **Locations**: ATMs, branches, online platforms, merchant names
- **Devices**: Phones, tablets, computers, unknown devices

#### **2. Flexible Fallback Extraction (Secondary)**
When regex patterns fail, the system employs **contextual field extraction**:

```python
def flexible_field_extraction(self, log_str: str) -> Dict:
    # Extract user ID patterns
    user_match = re.search(r'user(\d+)', log_str, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Extract monetary amounts with currency detection
    amount_patterns = [
        r'[\‚Ç¨\$\¬£]\s*[\d,]+\.?\d*',  # $500.00, ‚Ç¨1,200.50
        r'amt[:\s=]*[\‚Ç¨\$\¬£]?[\d,]+\.?\d*',  # amt:500.00
    ]
    
    # Extract device patterns
    device_patterns = [
        r'\b(iPhone|Android|Samsung|MacBook|Windows)[\w\s\d]*',
        r'device[:\s=]*([^,\|\-\n]+)',
    ]
```

#### **3. Data Cleaning & Normalization**
- **Currency Standardization**: All amounts converted to USD equivalent
- **Timestamp Parsing**: Handles 10+ datetime formats automatically
- **Field Validation**: Ensures essential fields (user, action, amount, timestamp) are present
- **Null Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing optional fields

#### **4. Quality Metrics & Monitoring**
```python
Parsing Results:
   Total logs: 1000
   Successfully parsed: 992
   Failed to parse: 8
   Success rate: 99.2%
   
Pattern Usage:
   Pattern_1 (Standard): 450 matches
   Pattern_2 (Pipe-separated): 320 matches
   Pattern_3 (Natural language): 180 matches
   Flexible extraction: 42 matches
```

##  Modeling Approach

### Multi-Layer Anomaly Detection Architecture

Our ensemble approach combines **domain expertise** with **advanced machine learning** for maximum accuracy and interpretability.

#### **Layer 1: Rule-Based Detection (Domain Knowledge)**

Six critical business rules based on financial fraud patterns:

| Rule | Description | Threshold | Business Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **High Amount** | Transaction >3œÉ above user's historical mean | Z-score > 3 | Unusual spending patterns |
| **Night Transactions** | Activity during high-risk hours | 11PM - 6AM | Reduced user awareness |
| **Device Change** | Different device than user's primary | Binary flag | Account compromise indicator |
| **Location Change** | Different location than user's primary | Binary flag | Geographic impossibility |
| **Rapid Transactions** | Multiple transactions <60 seconds apart | <60 seconds | Automated attack patterns |
| **Unusual Actions** | Rare transaction types for user | Rarity score >0.1 | Behavioral deviation |

```python
# Composite scoring
rule_anomaly_score = sum(triggered_rules)
anomaly_flag = rule_anomaly_score >= 2  # At least 2 rules triggered
```

#### **Layer 2: Statistical Detection (Machine Learning)**

##### **Isolation Forest Algorithm**
- **Purpose**: Detect outliers in high-dimensional feature space
- **Parameters**: 200 estimators, 5% contamination rate
- **Features**: 13 engineered features including behavioral patterns
- **Output**: Anomaly score and binary classification

```python
# Feature selection for ML models
feature_cols = [
    'amount', 'amount_zscore_user', 'hour', 'day_of_week', 'is_weekend',
    'user_amount_count', 'user_amount_mean', 'user_amount_std',
    'time_since_last_txn', 'device_inconsistency', 'location_inconsistency',
    'action_rarity_score', 'amount_percentile_user'
]
```

##### **DBSCAN Clustering**
- **Purpose**: Identify transaction clusters and isolate outliers
- **Parameters**: eps=0.5, min_samples=5
- **Logic**: Transactions that don't belong to any cluster are anomalous
- **Benefit**: Captures complex multi-dimensional patterns

#### **Layer 3: Ensemble Method (Weighted Combination)**

Combines all detection methods using optimized weights:

```python
ensemble_score = (
    0.3 * rule_score_normalized +      # Domain expertise
    0.4 * isolation_forest_score +     # Statistical outliers  
    0.3 * dbscan_anomaly_flag          # Cluster-based detection
)

# Final classification: Top 5% as anomalies
threshold = ensemble_score.quantile(0.95)
final_anomaly = ensemble_score >= threshold
```

#### **Advanced Feature Engineering (25+ Features)**

##### **Temporal Features**
- **Basic**: hour, day_of_week, month, is_weekend
- **Business**: is_business_hours, is_night_time
- **Risk**: hour_risk (weighted by historical fraud rates)

##### **User Behavioral Profiling**
- **Transaction patterns**: count, mean, std, min, max per user
- **Diversity metrics**: unique hours, locations, devices, actions
- **Z-scores**: How much current transaction deviates from user norm
- **Velocity**: Time between consecutive transactions

##### **Contextual Intelligence**
- **Device consistency**: Primary device vs. current device
- **Location consistency**: Primary location vs. current location  
- **Action rarity**: How common is this transaction type overall
- **Amount percentiles**: Where does this amount rank in user's history
